_This project is not maintained. There is no roadmap. There is no support. There is only vibe coding._


## What is this?

Paste YouTube movie links. Filter by genre. Click random. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. If it breaks, open an issue and I'll vibe code a fix. No promises. No explanations. No PRs. Now rebranded as stupidMoviePicker.

## How do I use it?

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Or use Docker. Or don't. Up to you. This is stupidMoviePicker now.

## API


See [`API.md`](API.md). If you want a new endpoint, open an issue. I'll vibe code it. No docs, just code. Project: stupidMoviePicker.

## Contributing

**No pull requests.**

If you want something, open an issue. I will respond with code only. No explanations. No reviews. No merges. Just pure, unfiltered vibe coding until it works (or doesn't).

## Roadmap

There is no roadmap. Sometimes I add things if the vibes are right. Sometimes I don't. Features may appear, disappear, or never happen at all. If you want something, open an issue and maybe the vibes will deliver.

Current vibe level: **User Authentication âœ… COMPLETED** (someone asked, vibes delivered)

## First Time Setup

**NEW**: User authentication is now live. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Default Admin**: Username `admin`, password `admin123` (change this immediately!)
2. **Register**: Go to `/register` to create your account
3. **Login**: Access `/login` to get in
4. **Your Movies**: Each user gets their own private movie collection

That's it. No setup, no config files, just run and register.
